abstract: Spatial vision was recently reported in a brittle star, Ophiomastix wendtii,
  which lacks discrete eyes, but little is known about its visual ecology. Our aim
  was to better characterize the vision and visual ecology of this unusual visual
  system. We tested animals' orientation relative to vertical bar stimuli at a range
  of angular widths and contrast, to identify limits of angular and contrast detection.
  We also presented dynamic shadow stimuli, either looming towards or passing overhead
  the animal, to test for potential defensive responses. Finally, we presented animals
  lacking a single arm with a vertical bar stimulus known to elicit a response in
  intact animals. We found that O. wendtii orients to large ($≥$50° ), high-contrast
  vertical bar stimuli, consistent with a shelter-seeking role and with photoreceptor
  acceptance angles estimated from morphology. We calculate poor optical sensitivity
  for individual photoreceptors, and predict dramatic oversampling for photoreceptor
  arrays. We also report responses to dark stimuli moving against a bright background
  - this is the first report of responses to moving stimuli in brittle stars and suggests
  additional defensive uses for vision in echinoderms. Finally, we found that animals
  missing a single arm orient worse to static stimuli, which requires further investigation.
