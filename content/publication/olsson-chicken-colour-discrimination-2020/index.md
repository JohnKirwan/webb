abstract: How well can a bird discriminate between two red berries on a green background?
  The absolute threshold of colour discrimination is set by photoreceptor noise, but
  animals do not perform at this threshold; their performance can depend on additional
  factors. In humans and zebra finches, discrimination thresholds for colour stimuli
  depend on background colour, and thus the adaptive state of the visual system. We
  have tested how well chickens can discriminate shades of orange or green presented
  on orange or green backgrounds. Chickens discriminated slightly smaller colour differences
  between two stimuli presented on a similarly coloured background, compared to a
  background of very different colour. The slope of the psychometric function is steeper
  when stimulus and background colours are similar but shallower when they differ
  markedly, indicating that background colour affects the certainty with which the
  animals discriminate the colours. The effect we find for chickens is smaller than
  that shown for zebra finches. We modelled the response to stimuli using Bayesian
  and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and implemented the psychometric function
  to estimate the effect size. We found that the result is independent of the psychophysical
  method used to evaluate the effect of experimental conditions on choice performance.
