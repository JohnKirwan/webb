abstract: Millipedes are a species-rich and ancient arthropod clade which typically
  bear a pair of lateral compound eyes with a small number of large facets. To understand
  the visual tasks that underlie the evolution of millipede eyes, their spatial resolving
  performance is of key importance. We here investigate the spatial resolution of
  the millipede Cylindroiulus punctatus using behavioural assays. Individual animals
  were placed in the centre of a cylindrical arena under bright downwelling light,
  with dark stimuli of varying angular dimensions placed on the arena wall. We used
  continuous isoluminant stimuli based on a difference of Gaussians signal to test
  for orientation to the dark target via object taxis. Headings of individual animals
  were tracked in relation to the stimuli to determine whether the animals oriented
  towards the stimulus. We implemented a multilevel logistic regression model to identify
  the arc width of the stimulus that animals could resolve. We then modelled the angular
  sensitivity needed to identify this. We also related the visual performance to the
  3D anatomy of the eye. We found that C. punctatus can resolve a stimulus of 56°
  period (sufficient to detect a 20° dark target). Assuming a contrast threshold of
  10%, this requires a receptor acceptance angle of 72° or narrower. Spatial resolving
  power this low would only suffice for the simplest visual tasks, such as shelter-seeking.
