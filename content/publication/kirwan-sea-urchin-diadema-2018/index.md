abstract: 'Skip to Next Section Many sea urchins can detect light on their body surface
  and some species are reported to possess image-resolving vision. Here, we measure
  the spatial resolution of vision in the long-spined sea urchin Diadema africanum,
  using two different visual responses: a taxis towards dark objects and an alarm
  response of spine-pointing towards looming stimuli. For the taxis response we used
  visual stimuli, which were isoluminant to the background, to discriminate spatial
  vision from phototaxis. Individual animals were placed in the centre of a cylindrical
  arena under bright down-welling light, with stimuli of varying angular width placed
  on the arena wall at alternating directions from the centre. We tracked the direction
  of movement of individual animals in relation to the stimuli to determine whether
  the animals oriented towards the stimulus. We found that D. africanum responds by
  taxis towards isoluminant stimuli with a spatial resolution in the range of 29–69
  deg. This corresponds to a theoretical acceptance angle of 38–89 deg, assuming a
  contrast threshold of 10%. The visual acuity of the alarm response of D. africanum
  was tested by exposing animals to different sized dark looming and appearing stimuli
  on a monitor. We found that D. africanum displays a spine-pointing response to appearing
  black circles of 13–25 deg angular width, corresponding to an acceptance angle of
  60–116 deg, assuming the same contrast threshold as above.'
