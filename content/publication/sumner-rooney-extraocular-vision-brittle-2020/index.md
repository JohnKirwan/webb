abstract: Almost all animals can sense light, but only those with spatial vision can
  ‘‘see.’’ Conventionally, this was restricted to animals possessing discrete visual
  organs (eyes), but extraocular vision could facilitate vision without eyes. Echinoderms
  form the focus of extraocular vision research [1–7], and the brittle star Ophiocoma
  wendtii, which exhibits light-responsive color change and shelter seeking, became
  a key species of interest [4, 8, 9]. Both O. wendtii and an apparently light-indifferent
  congeneric, O. pumila, possess an extensive network of r-opsin-reactive cells, but
  its function remains unclear [4]. We show that, although both species are strongly
  light averse, O. wendtii orients to stimuli necessitating spatial vision for detection,
  but O. pumila does not. However, O. wendtii’s response disappears when chromatophores
  are contracted within the skeleton. Combining immunohistochemistry, histology, and
  synchrotron microtomography, we reconstructed models of photoreceptors in situ and
  extracted estimated angular apertures for O. wendtii and O. pumila. Angular sensitivity
  estimates, derived from these models, support the hypothesis that chromatophores
  constitute a screening mechanism in O. wendtii, providing sufficient resolving power
  to detect the stimuli. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identified opsin candidates in both
  species, including multiple r-opsins and transduction pathway constituents, congruent
  with immunohistochemistry and studies of other echinoderms [10, 11]. Finally, we
  note that differing body postures between the two species during experiments may
  reflect aspect of signal integration. This represents one of the most detailed mechanisms
  for extraocular vision yet proposed and draws interesting parallels with the only
  other confirmed extraocular visual system, that of some sea urchins, which also
  possess chromatophores.
