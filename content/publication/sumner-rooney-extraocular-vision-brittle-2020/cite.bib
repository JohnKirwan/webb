 abstract = {Almost all animals can sense light, but only those with
spatial vision can ‘‘see.’’ Conventionally, this was
restricted to animals possessing discrete visual organs
(eyes), but extraocular vision could facilitate
vision without eyes. Echinoderms form the focus of
extraocular vision research [1–7], and the brittle star
Ophiocoma wendtii, which exhibits light-responsive
color change and shelter seeking, became a key
species of interest [4, 8, 9]. Both O. wendtii and an
apparently light-indifferent congeneric, O. pumila,
possess an extensive network of r-opsin-reactive
cells, but its function remains unclear [4]. We show
that, although both species are strongly light averse,
O. wendtii orients to stimuli necessitating spatial
vision for detection, but O. pumila does not. However,
O. wendtii’s response disappears when chromatophores
are contracted within the skeleton. Combining
immunohistochemistry, histology, and synchrotron
microtomography, we reconstructed models of photoreceptors
in situ and extracted estimated angular
apertures for O. wendtii and O. pumila. Angular sensitivity
estimates, derived from these models, support
the hypothesis that chromatophores constitute a
screening mechanism in O. wendtii, providing sufficient
resolving power to detect the stimuli. RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) identified opsin candidates in
both species, including multiple r-opsins and transduction
pathway constituents, congruent with immunohistochemistry
and studies of other echinoderms
[10, 11]. Finally, we note that differing body postures
between the two species during experiments may
reflect aspect of signal integration. This represents
one of the most detailed mechanisms for extraocular
vision yet proposed and draws interesting parallels
with the only other confirmed extraocular visual system,
that of some sea urchins, which also possess
chromatophores},
