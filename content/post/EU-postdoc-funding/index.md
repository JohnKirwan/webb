Here is a summary of some of the funding opportunities in the EU in for international early career researchers who have gotten their PhD. This is specifically in relation to the Life Sciences, but many have wider applicability. Look into these opportunities and the length of time they are available post-graduation.

Don’t be in a rush to defend as this date starts the clock for which you can apply for many things. If your defense is due before the end of the year, see if you can delay it: Some funding is limited on the calendar year of your graduation. Also, don’t rush to get papers published before your graduation, as some funding schemes only consider papers published thereafter.
